# [Macros Calculator](https://everybodykurts.github.io/Macros.Feliz/)

This is a macros calculator that determines a person's total daily calories and macronutrients based on their body weight, bodyfat %, and daily activity.

I am writing / wrote this F# and Elmish to demonstrate the beauty of F# code, the simplicity of the Elm UI model, as well as provide an understandable example of onion-style architecture.
